# ping-pong-game-coding-ninjas
This Ping Pong Game project was developed as an assignment during our Full Stack Development course at Coding Ninjas. It's a simple, classic ping pong game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to control paddles and compete to score points by hitting a ball back and forth.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.
2. Two paddles will appear at the bottom of the screen, and a ball will start bouncing between them.
3. Player 1 can control the left paddle using the 'A' and 'D' keys.
4. Player 2 can control the right paddle using the left and right arrow keys.
5. Press the 'Enter' key to begin the game.
6. The objective is to prevent the ball from hitting your side of the screen and to score points by hitting the ball past your opponent.
7. The game keeps track of the highest score achieved.
