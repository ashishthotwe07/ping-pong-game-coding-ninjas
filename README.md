# ping-pong-game-coding-ninjas
This Ping Pong Game project was developed as an assignment during our Full Stack Development course at Coding Ninjas. It's a simple, classic ping pong game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to control paddles and compete to score points by hitting a ball back and forth.
